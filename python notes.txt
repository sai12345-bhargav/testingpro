PYTHON NOTES


     LIST:  
          1.it contains a set of numbers or names or float values
          2.list should be in square brackets
              ex:list=['21','sai,'22.5']
          3.values in list can be changed by using different commands like append,insert,remove etc..
          4.when we are using commands we should use dot operator
             ex:  .append(),.pop()
    TUPLE:
          1.it is same as list but the values cant be changed in tuple
          2.tuple should be in round bracket
    SET:
          1.set is a collection of elements
          2.it will not follow the sequence of elements
          3.it should be in curly braces
            ex:set={12,23,45,67,89}
          4.it will not allow duplicate values means repetition of values
--> if you want to know address of a variable use the function id() in python 
           ex: name='navin'
                id(name) it gives the address of that name
--> if you have the same data for different variables it gives the same address
           ex: a=10,b=10;   
               id(a)  id(b) it gives the same address 
--> by using type() function you can determine which datatype it is
           ex: PI=3.14
                type(PI)   is float
   
   DATA TYPES:
     1.none
     2.numeric
     3.list
     4.tuple
     5.set
     6.string
     7.range
     8.dictonary-it should be in {} braces,it contains key        
                     ex:d={'sai':'oneplus','daddy':'redmi'}
